    "## Consumer Complaints Towards Financial Products\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:  \n",
    "When you experience trouble during or after purchasing a commercial product, you can seek help from varies consumer associations. Similarly, consumers of financial products can submit complaints and get the support from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB send the consumersâ€™ complaints to companies for response. These complaints and responses provide insight into problems that people are experiencing, help identify inappropriate practices.  \n",
    "???\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who might care?    \n",
    "**- Financial Companies:**   \n",
    "    Use this report to find insight into problems that people are experiencing, help identify inappropriate practices. The trends in the timing and location of the complaints would be valuable information for companies hoping to proactively improve their performance by keeping customer happy.   \n",
    "**- State and federal agencies:**  \n",
    "    Take the report data as an indicator of the quality of financial products by the companies. Could provide evidence for some market regulations.    \n",
    "**- Financial prducts Customers:**  \n",
    "    Consider this report as a reference for choosing a company for a certain financial product or service. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to analyze?  \n",
    "???  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data:  \n",
    "The financial customer complaint data can be downloaded on the CFPB website, consumer complaint database:   \n",
    "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/#download-the-data  \n",
    "The data set contains up-to-date (of this study) record of customer complaints since 2011. Its size is 560.9 MB.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of features:**  Product, Issue, Consumer complaint narrative, Company public response, Consumer disputed?, ...  \n",
    "\n",
    "The table explaining all the features of the data can be found here:  \n",
    "https://cfpb.github.io/api/ccdb/fields.html  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach to solving this problem:   \n",
    "The plan is to mainly use Python numpy and pandas package for data wrangling. The dataset will be cleaned to relavant variables and checked for inconsistencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's Scipy and statsmodel modules will be used to find statistic values and significance for this data set. Matplotlib and seaborn packages will largely implement the exploratory data analysis (EDA). Comparisons and correlations between variables can be analyzed and visualized. The preliminary questions should be answered after this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to see if there is a pattern in whether a complaint will be disputed later. To do this, the application of statistical modeling and machine-learning will be tested with Python's scikit-learn module. There will be Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Complaints Narrative and Company Response features of the data set and other classification methods on other non-text features.    \n",
